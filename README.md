# Text-File-Analyzer-
A Perl program meant to analyse text files.

This program accepts a text file in the command line, and will output many statistics of that file, including the line count, word count, and character count. Also filters for common stop-words, and reports the frequency of stop-words in the document, as well as displaying the top 10 most frequently-appearing words and the longest/shortest words.

Command Line argument '-p' will allow the user to paste text directly from their clipboard into the command line to be processed as if it were a text file. Pasted text must be within double-quotes.
